    title: 'THE TALE OF PYRO PEPE: The Frog Who Loved Fire...'
    subtitle: >-
      Once upon a time, deep within the marshes of Pepeville, lived a small
      green frog named Pyro Pepe. Unlike other young frogs who spent their days
      hopping between lily pads and catching flies, Pyro Pepe had a peculiar
      obsession—he loved fire. While his frog friends croaked and splashed in
      the cool waters, Pyro Pepe would sit quietly by the banks, mesmerized by
      the flickering light of a bonfire on the horizon. He loved the warmth, the
      power, and most of all, the way it consumed everything in its path,
      leaving only ashes and the faint scent of smoke behind. As Pyro Pepe grew
      older, so did his fascination with flames. He started small, lighting
      matches in secret, setting dry leaves alight, and watching with glee as
      the fire spread. He found joy in watching the world around him burn, not
      in destruction, but in the beauty of its transformation. The crackling
      sound of wood turning to ash was music to his ears, and the orange glow of
      fire became his best friend. But Pyro Pepe wasn’t a reckless frog. No, he
      was clever. He knew that destruction could lead to something far greater:
      scarcity. "When everything burns," he thought, "what's left becomes rare.
      And rarity is value." With this thought in mind, he began to see fire not
      just as a toy, but as a tool for wealth. As he grew into adulthood, Pyro
      Pepe inherited a vast fortune of assets—land, collectibles, and even a
      treasure trove of rare artifacts. But none of these riches satisfied his
      burning desire. Instead, he devised a grand plan. With a mischievous grin,
      he started setting small fires around his properties. He would watch them
      go up in flames, reducing grand estates to cinders, one by one. His
      friends and family were horrified. "Pyro Pepe, why are you destroying
      everything you’ve worked for?" they cried. But Pepe only smiled.
      "Because," he said with a glint in his eye, "what's left will be
      priceless." And he was right. As Pyro Pepe continued his fiery path,
      everything he once loved became rarer and rarer. His few remaining
      assets—untouched by his flames—skyrocketed in value. The treasures he
      didn’t burn became legendary, their worth multiplied by the stories of the
      ones he set ablaze. People from far and wide came to see the remnants of
      what he had destroyed, and they paid handsomely for what little was left.
      Pyro Pepe had become a legend in his own right—an eccentric, wealthy frog
      who turned his love for fire into a pathway to riches. His actions had
      made his remaining assets scarce, and therefore, immensely valuable. In
      his old age, Pyro Pepe would sit by the fire—still entranced by its
      glow—but now with a fortune greater than he ever dreamed. And so, Pyro
      Pepe's tale became a lesson for all of Pepeville. While many feared his
      flames, others understood the genius behind the madness. The frog who
      loved fire had burned everything he cherished, but in doing so, he had
      made everything that remained precious beyond measure. And to this day,
      his name is spoken in hushed tones—a rich pyromaniac who turned
      destruction into gold.
